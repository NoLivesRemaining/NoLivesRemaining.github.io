                    I'm an Irish game developer with a passion for telling stories that resonate with people. I believe that games as a medium offer unique potential for engaging, immersive tales that can stick with a player for a lifetime.

                    I love to keep busy and explore new hobbies. I often have miultiple personal projects ongoing at any given time. I am a huge TTRPG nerd. I have been running games on weekends since 2017 and I've recently started running games online as a freelance Dungeon Master. Also, I started a Youtube channel where I write, record, edit and publish audiobook-style short stories.

                    My most recent venture has been into non-alcoholic mixology. I started with recipes from the internet and now craft my own with more advanced techniques and combinations.
