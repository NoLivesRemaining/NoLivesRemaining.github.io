                    I'm an Irish game developer with a passion for telling stories and its my opinion that games are the best platform for creating tales that resonate with people far deeper than any non-interactive medium.

                    I often keep myself busy, even in my free time. Idle hands drive me mad so I often have multiple personal projects ongoing at any given time. I am a huge TTRPG nerd and have gone so far as to sign up for a Freelance Dungeon Master service on top of the multiple games I run on my weekends. On top of this, I started a channel Youtube where I write, record, edit and publish audio book-style short stories.

                    Lastly, my most recent venture has been into non-alcoholic mixology. I started with recipes from the internet and later crafted my own with more advanced techniques and combinations.
