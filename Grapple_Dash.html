Grapple Dash is a simple 3D movement-focused game inpsired by the Hookshot from The Legend of Zelda series. This was my first solo outing with Unreal Engine 5 and to turn this project into a challenge I gave myself a restricted timeframe of a single weekend and a theme of 'swinging' akin to a Game Jam.
</p><p>
I spent the first day working on the swinging mechanic, using Unreal's Blueprints system to create a cable the player would shoot out of their weapon via a raycast. If it struck one of the grappling points, it would attach and the player would be pulled forwards with a vector. To keep the player moving, I enforced a time window that would sever the players cable. Once disconnected, by choice or by force, the player would then enter a brief slow motion while falling to allow them to connect to another grapple point.
</p><p>
Once the grappling system felt how I was hoping, I created some glowing materials to give lighting to the course and denote which objects were able to be fired at. I also created objective rings that would rotate slowly in order to provide a challenge as the player would need to either time their approach or come in from the right angle. Next I created basic UI such as the reticle and objective counter using Blueprints and then switched to C++ for the 'grapple meter' to allow for a smoother change in its visuals.
</p><p>
Finally, I built the course using assets I obtained from Unreal's FAB marketplace, arranged everything to my liking and tested for bugs. With that, it was ready to share.
