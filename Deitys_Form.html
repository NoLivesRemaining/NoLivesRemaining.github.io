<p>
I was brought onto the Lemonchili team as a Junior Programmer and assigned to the team as they were mid-way through creating the studios biggest game to date; Super Farming Boy. The game is a farming sim where each crop has a unique harvest pattern that a clever player can set up to set off a chain reaction and harvest their entire farm in one go.
</p><p>
I was initially responsible for bug fixing and improving/reworking older systems that were now depreciated. These included the oxygen & stamina UI, the in-game menu & wiki database, & the system that detects whether the player is outside and what weather effects the player is currently under.
</p><p>
After a year, I was promoted to a Programmer and given more responsibilities for more complicated systems within Super Farming Boy. I refined the pathfinding AI of the NPC's within the game to work properly with our bounds system while simultaneously working with our cell-based for the player because in its state at the time, the player pathfinding would often break when interacting with moving NPCs or when trying to reach a static NPC or object that was behind an impassible barrier. I created a shared function for NPCs that would assign static NPC's a dedicated 'Interact cell' while roaming NPC's would generate an 'Interact point' once the player clicked on them. Then I had the pathfinding take obstacles into account while creating the path. I was also given the secondary responsibility of animation integration, creating different animation states for the face to allow the player character dynamic expressions.
</p><p>
Near the end of my second year working on Super Farming Boy, I was half of a two-person team tasked with revamping the in-game economy where added multiple new elements. Each needed to work as both a unique resource and as a collective currency for the purposes of specific crops and upgrades that would require a specific combination of resources. It also required the shop logic and UI to be overhauled.
</p><p>
Getting to work on Super Farming Boy gave me experience working on a large scale project with a big team. It also gave me the chance to expand my skills by working alone for large portions of the day due to the work being remote and most of the team being in a different timezone.
