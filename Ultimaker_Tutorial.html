<p>
Most of my responsibilities for this project were frontloaded. I worked closely with the client to discuss what features we'd need, plan out how we could achieve them and communicate that plan with the team. From there I managed the teams workload from week to week while regularly giving updates to the client and running playtests. 
</p><p>
From week to week, I assisted the technical lead by handling asset integration; combining art, audio, writing, animation and level design to build the functional scene in Unity and ensure all of the scripts worked together in each build. I was also responsible for fixing any bugs that were found during playtests or by other members of the team.
